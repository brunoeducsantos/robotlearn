 My name is `Bruno Santos` and I am `Autonomous Robotics Engineer` at [Dynium](https://dynium.ai/) developing mapping, perception and localization solutions using LiDAR applied to mobile robotics in agriculture.
 
In my spare time, I enjoy learning more about deep learning, robotics, and programming using online-learning platforms such as [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). Indeed, I enjoy the freedom of online-learning and how it has been helping me to make a transition from Physics to Robotics Engineering. The completion of [Sensor Fusion](https://www.udacity.com/course/sensor-fusion-engineer-nanodegree--nd313) and [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) helped me starting the knowledge staircase to my robotics and computer vision endeavour.

During my past life, during my master thesis, I worked on cosmic rays research at [LIP](https://lip.pt/) partnering with [AMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/ams) and [ISS](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html).
