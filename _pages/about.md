 I am Autonomous Robotics Engineer at [Dynium](https://dynium.ai/) developing mapping and perception solutions using LiDAR.
 
In my spare time, I enjoy learning more about deep learning, robotics, and programming using online-learning platforms such as [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). Indeed, I enjoy the freedom of online learning and how it has helped me to make a transition from Physics to Robotics Engineering. By completing Sensor Fusion and Computer Vision Nanodegree, I started to climb the knowledge stair to robotics odyssey.

In my past life, during my master thesis, I worked on cosmic rays research at [LIP](https://lip.pt/) partnering with [AMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/ams) and [ISS](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html).
